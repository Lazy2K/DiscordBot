# DiscordBot
This is my first ever project on Github, it's going to be my process of building a discord bot in Python.




Update (05/10/19): This bot is really old now and I've made much more advanced features.

Update (08/10/19): I've now added one of my other discord bots called "Linked". I've also added my other bot called "Doug's Developer Bot" this bot was supposed to assist me whist programming. (Neither "Linked" or "Dougsdeveloperbot" are fully finnished, they are simply examples.
